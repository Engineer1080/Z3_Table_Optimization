# Z3_Table_Optimization
The aim of this project is to solve a simplified version of a very common problem, instances of which appear in scheduling, production planning, resource allocation, etc. The problem is to find integer values with which to fill an m Ã— n table, ensuring that given constraints on the values are met, that the sum of the values in the table is minimal.
